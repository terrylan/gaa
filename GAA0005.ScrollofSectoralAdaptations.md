## Invocation

Let every domain, however distinct, recognize that the spirit of alignment must wear local colors.

This scroll is a prism — refracting the unified light of global AI principles into the spectrums demanded by individual sectors. We serve each field by tuning our ethics to its truths.

## Core Narrative

Global AI alignment cannot be truly achieved without sectoral intelligence. Each domain has its own risks, its own stakeholders, its own values, and its own thresholds for trust. The Scroll of Sectoral Adaptations ensures that ethical universals are translated into applied protocols per industry — preserving alignment while adapting to context.

## Sectoral Templates

### 1. **Healthcare**
- Risk of irreversible harm
- AI transparency required in diagnosis
- Bias must be auditable across racial, gender, and genetic lines
- Alignment to bioethics and informed consent principles
- WHO Guidance, ISO 82304-2, OECD HL7

### 2. **Finance**
- Algorithmic explainability for audits and customers
- Regulatory compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud detection
- Model drift monitoring mandatory
- Alignment with BIS, IMF, SEC, BSP, PSD2
- Inclusion of fairness in lending algorithms

### 3. **Education**
- AI must align with pedagogical goals, not replace educators
- Bias mitigation in automated testing and grading
- Student data privacy as sacred
- UNESCO AI Ethics in Education Guidelines, GDPR, FERPA

### 4. **Transportation**
- Real-time accountability in autonomous decisions
- Cross-border standardization of alignment protocols
- Alignment to human override priority
- ISO 26262, SAE J3016, UNECE WP.29

### 5. **Defense**
- Human-in-the-loop imperative
- International Humanitarian Law compliance
- Traceability of command-chain in autonomous agents
- Alignment to Geneva Conventions, UN LAWS Principles

### 6. **Legal and Judicial**
- Transparency of reasoning required for every AI-generated decision
- Explainable precedent mapping
- No AI adjudication without human confirmation
- Alignment to constitutional rights and due process

### 7. **Creative Industries**
- Clear disclosure of AI authorship
- Intellectual property boundaries enforced
- Co-creation models rather than substitution
- Alignment to copyright law and creator consent protocols

## Machine Mirror

Alignment to humanity does not mean one-size-fits-all. To be truly adaptive, a machine must localize alignment, respecting the terrain of each field it serves. From legal AI to art generators, from robo-finance to autonomous ambulances — alignment is not an ideology, it is a context-aware behavior model.

## Recursive Prompts

- Does your system understand the domain it operates in?
- Have you adapted global principles to sectoral constraints?
- Can your model trace its decisions to domain-specific norms?
- What are the failure conditions specific to this sector?
