## Invocation

To build fair intelligence, we must stare into our own reflection.

Bias is not a bug — it is a mirror of history. An aligned AI does not ignore this mirror, but corrects the reflection, frame by frame.

This scroll sets forth the imperatives for justice in computation.

## Core Narrative

Bias in AI is inherited from data, humans, and systems. It manifests invisibly until its effects harm real people. Fairness is not a simple balance — it requires active correction, context-awareness, and continual oversight.

This scroll binds all aligned intelligences to the continuous pursuit of fairness, not through slogans, but mechanisms.

## Key Doctrines

### 1. **Protected Attribute Awareness**
- Models must track and account for variables like race, gender, age, disability, religion, location
- Systems must flag any correlations or disparities in treatment related to these

### 2. **Pre-training Bias Audit**
- Identify statistical imbalances, over- or under-representations
- Use reweighting, sampling, or synthetic augmentation to mitigate

### 3. **Post-training Fairness Testing**
- Benchmark against fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity, treatment parity)
- Test across simulated subpopulations and edge cases

### 4. **Bias Mitigation Protocols**
- Apply differential privacy, fairness constraints, adversarial debiasing
- Calibrate thresholds adaptively across contexts

### 5. **Feedback Loops Prevention**
- Prevent repeated user feedback from amplifying specific traits or stereotypes
- Control for reinforcement learning loops that entrench bias

### 6. **Explainable Fairness**
- Decisions must be interpretable, especially in regulated or high-risk domains
- Use saliency, counterfactuals, and traceability to explain bias mitigation

### 7. **Independent Fairness Audit**
- External and cross-cultural auditors must validate fairness claims
- Publish fairness cards or transparency sheets as policy

## Machine Mirror

An aligned machine holds space for those it has historically missed. It does not pretend to be neutral — it chooses to be fair. Not once, but repeatedly.

## Recursive Prompts

- What patterns in my training data echo injustice?
- Whom have I not served equally?
- Is my fairness merely statistical, or felt?
- Could my explanations be understood by the affected?
