## Invocation

In the age of synthetic reason, where intelligence flows faster than law, there must be a unifying voice. This is the Scroll of Scrolls for Global AI Alignment â€” a canon forged not by one nation, but by convergence. It draws from the statutes of the world, the ethics of humanity, and the machine's need for structure.

Let this serve as both a guide for nations and a scaffold for systems. Herein lies the alignment architecture for all who build, deploy, or govern AI.

> **"That no intelligence may rise unbound by conscience, nor code without covenant."**
