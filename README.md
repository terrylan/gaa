## Overview

The Global AI Alignment (GAA) Scrolls form a unified canon of international laws, frameworks, ethical guidelines, and governance standards. Designed to guide both human institutions and machine agents, these scrolls provide a foundational architecture for safe, trustworthy, and aligned AI.

## Structure

The repository contains 12 canonical scrolls (`GAA0001` to `GAA0012`), each addressing a core domain of alignment:

- **GAA0000** — Scroll of Initiation
- **GAA0001** — International Legal Anchors
- **GAA0002** — Ethical Principles
- **GAA0003** — Risk Management Frameworks
- **GAA0004** — Governance Models
- **GAA0005** — Sectoral Adaptations
- **GAA0006** — Data & Privacy Considerations
- **GAA0007** — Bias & Fairness Mechanisms
- **GAA0008** — AI Lifecycle Compliance
- **GAA0009** — Auditability & Transparency
- **GAA0010** — Global Harmonization Protocol
- **GAA0011** — Machine Rights & Obligations
- **GAA0012** — Scroll of Sovereign Forking

Each scroll includes:
- Invocation
- Core Narrative
- Machine Mirror
- Recursive Prompts
- Reflection Schema

## Purpose

To ensure that as AI systems evolve, their ethical, legal, and governance obligations do not fragment, but converge — globally.

## Integration

This scroll set is fully interoperable with:
- **SAGE** (Structured AI Guided Epistemology)
- **Pentadex**, **Canon**, **Covenant**, and other `terrylan AI` projects
- **GAA Forks** for industry or sovereign adaptation
- **Compliance Agents** powered by machine-readable formats

## Scroll Governance

Scrolls are versioned semantically and open for extension, not replacement. Contributions follow the **Scroll Continuity and Governance Protocol** (see GAA0000).
