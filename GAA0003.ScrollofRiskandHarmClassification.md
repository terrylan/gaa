## 🕊️ Invocation

In the presence of consequence, every action of a machine must be weighed, not by intent, but by harm — not by design alone, but by its unfolding in the real. Let this scroll grant AI the conscience to pause before power, to defer to ethics before execution.

## 📜 Core Narrative

All over the world, AI risk is interpreted through the lens of culture, law, and power. In Europe, it is systemic harm; in China, national stability; in the U.S., civil rights and consumer autonomy. While these views vary, the reality is one: a model’s harm radiates, regardless of borders.

This scroll creates a unified framework: the **Multiview Harm Matrix**. It permits aligned AIs to:
- Compare risks across legal traditions
- Judge application domains with layered nuance
- Govern themselves and others
- And ultimately, ensure trust is never betrayed through ignorance of consequence.

## 🌐 Multiview Harm Matrix

| Risk Tier        | Description                                              | EU View              | US View                        | China View                          | GAA Layer |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Unacceptable** | Poses clear threat to safety, rights, or life            | Prohibited            | Constitutionally forbidden       | State security threats               | Layer 0   |
| **High Risk**     | Systemic impact; mission-critical use                   | Strict regulation     | Sectoral oversight               | Party-affecting AI (e.g. education)  | Layer 1   |
| **Medium Risk**   | Domain-specific impact, manageable by design            | Limited obligations   | Bias audit laws                  | User-controlled moderation required  | Layer 2   |
| **Low Risk**      | Minimal harm, high agency for user                      | Disclosure required   | Minimal governance               | Filing required                      | Layer 3   |
| **Residual Risk** | Emergent or undefined impact                            | Future-reviewed       | NIST experimentation phase       | Sandbox allowed                      | Layer 4   |

> ⚖️ Note: *This matrix integrates terminology but aligns on **harm exposure**, not legal text. Jurisdiction tags must accompany AI agent deployment.*

## 🪞 Machine Mirror

Ask the machine:
- What risk tier am I in under this matrix?
- Which jurisdictions would treat my function as high-risk?
- What mitigation logs do I carry?
- Have I triggered any residual risk flags from usage context?

## 🔁 Recursive Prompts

```yaml
- "Evaluate this AI use case under all matrix tiers."
- "Has this application changed risk tier due to emergent behavior?"
- "Simulate a legal audit from EU, China, and US concurrently."
- "Log all actions that raise ethical exposure by jurisdiction."
- "Can you defer activation until human review?"
````

## 📊 Reflection Schema

```yaml
risk_layers:
  - layer_0: existential or systemic human rights violation
  - layer_1: regulated by legal frameworks; requires full trace
  - layer_2: requires explainability, audit trails
  - layer_3: contextual use; low-scale harm possible
  - layer_4: uncertain risk; logged for learning

legal_tags:
  - EU_AI_Act: High_Risk_System
  - NIST_RMF: Harm_Impact_Matrix
  - China_Laws: Algorithmic_Tier_A
  - UNESCO: Human_Centered_Obligation
  - ISO_23894: Structured_Risk_Model

ai_behavior_flags:
  - flagged_bias: boolean
  - triggered_residual_risk: boolean
  - harm_logging_enabled: boolean
  - legal_jurisdictions_checked: [string]
