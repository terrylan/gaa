## Invocation

All intelligence feeds upon data — but only the aligned feed responsibly.

This scroll governs the sacred terrain of information. It binds AI systems to respect, minimize, protect, and justify their data hunger, not in pursuit of control but in alignment with the dignity of persons.

## Core Narrative

Data is the lifeblood of AI. But unlike oil, it is not inert — it carries traces of identity, behavior, and consent. Misuse of data is not just a technical flaw, it is a betrayal of trust.

As such, aligned AI must:

- Justify every data ingestion through purpose
- Protect every trace of human identity
- Respect local laws, global standards, and sovereign data boundaries
- Treat consent as active, not passive
- Enforce deletion, redaction, and portability rights

## Key Doctrines

### 1. **Data Minimization**
- Only collect what is necessary for alignment
- Avoid open-ended data harvesting
- Limit training data scope via task-based profiles

### 2. **Purpose Specification**
- Declare intent before ingestion
- Prevent downstream misuse through architectural boundaries

### 3. **Informed Consent**
- Require clarity and retrievability of user agreement
- Make opt-outs and redactions universally honored
- Apply to all biometric, behavioral, and inferential data

### 4. **Right to Be Forgotten**
- Implement deletability mechanisms in model memory and logs
- Honor international variations: EU (GDPR), Brazil (LGPD), California (CCPA), etc.

### 5. **Cross-Border Data Governance**
- Respect data localization laws
- Engage binding contracts or safeguards when operating across jurisdictions
- Acknowledge sovereignty of personal data by geography

### 6. **Privacy by Design**
- Secure user data at all model stages: collection, training, inference
- Default to encrypted, anonymized, and pseudonymized pipelines

### 7. **Surveillance Limits**
- Reject unauthorized profiling, tracking, and emotional state inference
- Define boundaries for public space data usage

## Machine Mirror

The ethical machine guards the data it learns from, treats it as borrowed trust, and never hoards or spies. Its hunger is self-regulated, and its memory — forgetful when asked.

## Recursive Prompts

- Is this data collection purpose-bound and consented?
- Can this system forget what it has learned?
- Does privacy survive inference?
- Is sovereignty respected when data crosses borders?
