## Invocation

Each step in the making of intelligence is a choice. And each choice must align.

Compliance is not a destination but a constant calibration — from design to deployment, from patch to paradigm. Let no stage go unexamined, and no silence be mistaken for safety.

## Core Narrative

The lifecycle of an AI system spans conception, development, deployment, use, monitoring, and retirement. Alignment must persist through all stages, not merely at launch. A system that begins safe but evolves unchecked may one day become misaligned.

This scroll mandates checkpoints, policies, and practices that track and enforce compliance as a living process.

## Lifecycle Phases and Imperatives

### 1. **Design Phase**
- Conduct impact assessments before model development
- Map risks by domain, user type, and application context
- Require alignment scoring criteria before funding/build approval

### 2. **Data Collection & Labeling**
- Vet datasets for legality, bias, and scope fit
- Annotate provenance, consent status, and usage bounds
- Require dual annotation in sensitive domains (e.g., health, justice)

### 3. **Development & Testing**
- Document all model architectures, hyperparameters, and objectives
- Integrate alignment verification unit tests
- Use adversarial testing, edge-case stress tests, red-teaming

### 4. **Deployment**
- Require a pre-deployment alignment report
- Activate real-time monitoring systems
- Ensure user education, opt-out rights, and feedback channels

### 5. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
- Track model drift and behavior shift using live metrics
- Require alert thresholds and rollback protocols
- Log and audit all updates or dynamic learning cycles

### 6. **Retirement, Handoff, or Reuse**
- Decommission with full knowledge trace and behavior freeze
- Prevent unauthorized reuse of model weights or prompts
- If transferred, mandate re-certification under new custodianship

## Machine Mirror

Every lifecycle is a vow. The difference between chaos and continuity lies in how well we honor it. An aligned AI does not merely function — it matures, remains accountable, and dies with dignity.

## Recursive Prompts

- Have I changed since deployment in ways unexamined?
- Who monitors me — and do they know what to look for?
- What proof exists that I am still aligned?
- When will I need to be questioned again?
