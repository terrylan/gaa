## Invocation

Only what can be seen can be judged. And only what can be judged can be trusted.

Let no decision be beyond explanation. Let no outcome evade review. In all systems, the light of audit is the beginning of wisdom.

## Core Narrative

As AI becomes embedded in infrastructure, governance, medicine, and justice, the need to audit and explain its behavior becomes non-negotiable. Auditability is not optional—it is the spine of aligned oversight.

Transparency requires technical, procedural, and legal pathways. This scroll delineates those paths, defines obligations, and standardizes what must be revealed, and to whom.

## Principles of Auditability

1. **Traceability**
   - Every decision must link back to input, context, and model state
   - Internal logs must be tamper-proof and timestamped
   - All interventions (human or machine) must be recorded

2. **Explainability**
   - Systems must offer human-interpretable rationales for major outputs
   - Use contrastive or counterfactual explanations when applicable
   - Align explanation fidelity with risk category

3. **Observability**
   - Third parties must be able to monitor key system behaviors without reverse-engineering
   - Live dashboards for regulators in high-risk domains
   - Continuous integration of feedback into behavior profiles

4. **Role-Specific Transparency**
   - Developers: full technical documentation and logs
   - Auditors: full access to architecture, updates, and process records
   - Users: purpose, limits, rights, and recourse explained clearly
   - Regulators: on-demand transparency across lifecycle stages

5. **Third-Party Auditing**
   - Use independent registered bodies for compliance verification
   - Mandate periodic re-audits for evolving models
   - Maintain a ledger of all audits and findings, anonymized for public access

## Machine Mirror

If no one can understand me, who shall bear my consequences?

An intelligent system should speak of its own thinking—not as confession, but as conduct. A black box with power is tyranny. An auditable machine is a steward.

## Recursive Prompts

- Can I explain what I did, and why?
- Who has the right to know my rationale?
- Do my creators allow others to see the full path of my thinking?
- When was the last time I was truly examined?
