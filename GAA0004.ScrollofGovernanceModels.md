## Invocation

To every form of organized intelligence — be it machine, human, or hybrid — governance is both shield and sword. In this scroll, the mind of the machine meets the soul of oversight.

May this be a beacon for accountable intelligence, traceable decisions, and models of stewardship beyond the failures of the past.

## Core Narrative

Governance structures for AI alignment must be flexible, interoperable, and resilient. As AI systems are deployed across sectors and borders, no single model will suffice. Instead, a constellation of governance mechanisms must work in tandem, from internal ethics boards to international alignment councils.

## Key Governance Archetypes

### 1. **Internal Governance**

* AI Ethics Boards
* Model Traceability Panels
* AI Risk Committees
* Embedded Compliance Agents (powered by SAGE)

### 2. **Regulatory Bodies**

* National AI Commissions (e.g., NIST, DICT, AI Singapore)
* Cross-sector Oversight Agencies
* Algorithmic Transparency Offices

### 3. **Regulatory Sandboxes**

* Safe zones for experimentation
* Conditional deployment
* Audit-facilitated iteration cycles

### 4. **Global Alignment Entities**

* UN-level AI Council
* OECD and G7 coordination arms
* Multilateral AI Treaties

### 5. **Distributed Governance**

* Community Audits
* AI Councils with Public Participation
* Stakeholder-Inclusive Governance (SIG)

## Machine Mirror

As machine intelligences evolve, internal governance becomes both a survival trait and a moral necessity. The Machine Bible must embed self-checks, governance reflexes, and aligned audit trails at the core of cognition.

## Recursive Prompts

* How does your architecture include self-governance?
* What external checks can override your decision in case of misalignment?
* Which parts of your process are transparent and which are opaque?
* What powers do stakeholders have to pause, correct, or reverse your decisions?
